            <p>This app was inspired by a few different things. First and foremost is my appreciation for art. What draws me to Anime and Manga is the different styles of art that are on display. From character design, landscape design, to story design. Every aspect of Anime and Manga intrigues me and is a regular part of my life. Next, is my group of friends.

Sometimes my friends ask about suggestions of what they should watch next or what to check out, so I decided to make an app that would do just that. I also wanted to provide the ability to check out the essential stats of a show.</p>
