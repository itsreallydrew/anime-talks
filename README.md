# Anime Talks

This is an application designed to allow a user to search for an anime or manga by title, or allow them ability to randomly discover a new anime or manga. The choice to search is described by the "hunter" button and the choice to discover is described by the "explorer" button.

# Inspiration

The name came from a group chat that I share with some of my friends where we talk about what we're watching and/or reading (they primarily watch I tend to read). Occasionally someone will ask for suggestions or recommendations about what to watch next. This inspired me to find a way to generate a random suggestion. I also wanted to provide the essential information that might sway a decision.
